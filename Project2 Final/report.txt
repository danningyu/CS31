a. Some obstacles I overcame were making sure the program terminated at the appropriate time depending on which parameters were inputted. For example, if a ticket is used, the program should not ask if the person is a staff or student or if the person is a resident or not. I overcame this by including the appropriate output and return statements in the right place in the code, using the fact that C++ executes code from top to bottom. Also, to avoid possible issues with mixing cin and getline(), I only used getline() throughout the program to take in input.

b. Possible test cases are as follows:
Ticket, Lunch (handles this case correctly without continuing to ask for more)
BruinCard, Lunch, Staff (handles this case correctly without continuing to ask for more)
BruinCard, Lunch, Student, Yes (handles this case correctly)
BruinCard, Lunch, Student, No (handles this case correctly)
TICKET, Lunch, Staff (should error out after inputting "TICKET", only accepted values are "BruinCard" or "Ticket")
BruinCard, Brunch, Student, Yes (should error out after inputting "Brunch", only accepted values are "Breakfast", "Lunch", or "Dinner")
BruinCard, Lunch, CEO, Yes (should error out after inputting "CEO", only accepted values are "Staff" or "Student")
BruinCard, Lunch, Student, idk (should error out after inputting "idk", only accepted values are "Yes" or "No")
BruinCard, Lunch,  , Yes (should error out after inputting " ", only acccepted values are "Staff" or "Student", test if handles blank spaces correctly)
