Project Report

a. The main obstacle I had to overcome was figuring out how all the classes (Die, Player, Board, and Pig) interacted with each other to create a full game. Because the skeleton code was provided for me, I was not able to structure the program in my own way, so I had to understand how it was structured. Another obstacle was setting the score to 0 when the turn ended but also updating the total with the score while being careful to not double count. I accomplished this by setting the total to the current total plus the score and then setting the score to 0 (order matters). Also, specifically handling the case of the die rolling a 1, causing the score to be set to 0 and the turn to be over was an special case that I had to handle. Finally, I had to make sure that no changes could be made once the game was over (that is, the winning score was met or exceeded), so I had to surround many of my implementations of updating the scores and totals to check first (with an if-statement) if the game was already over.

b. My test code is below. To test the Pig class more thoroughly, I created two helper functions, getHuman() and getComputer(), which allow for access to the mHuman and mComputer data members in the Pig class, and using these functions, I could directly check their current scores.

	Die d; //declaring objects for testing
	Player p;
	Board b;
	Pig game;

	//test code for die
	for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
		d.roll();
		int a = d.getValue();
		assert(a <= 6 && a >= 1);
	}

	//test code for plyaer
	assert(p.getScore() == 0); //starting score is 0
	assert(p.getTotal() == 0); //starting total is 0
	assert(p.roll(2) == 2); //should return 2
	assert(p.getScore() == 2); //current score should be 2
	assert(p.getTotal() == 0); //current total should be 0 because turn not ended
	assert(p.roll(4) == 4); //rolling a 4 should return a 4
	assert(p.getScore() == 6); //total score should be a 6
	assert(p.getTotal() == 0); //total score should still be 0
	p.endTurn();
	assert(p.getTotal() == 6); //total score should be 6 now
	assert(p.getScore() == 0); //score should be 0 (should have been moved to total)
	assert(p.roll(3) == 3); //rolling a 3 should return a 3
	assert(p.getTotal() == 6); //total should be unchanged
	p.endTurn();
	assert(p.getTotal() == 9); //6+3=9
	assert(p.getScore() == 0); //score should be reset
	assert(p.roll(3) == 3);
	assert(p.roll(1) == 1); //should return 1 for rolling a 1
